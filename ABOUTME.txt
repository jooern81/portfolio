From perspective that follows my timeline of employment, my first role would be a waiter at a ramen restaurant, this was followed by tutoring and personal training (I'm NCSF certified). I then worked at the Ministry of Transport Futures Division for half a year, formulating drone regulations and introducing applications to the government sector. This was followed by 2 years in the military where I was commissioned as an officer (Lieutenant) and served in the Combat Service Support HQ as a manpower officer. After this I took up the Singapore Industries Full Term Scholarship where I majored in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Product Design at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. During my studies, I had the privilege of completing an exchange program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and also got to participate in several overseas programs such as the Architectural Association Visting School Programme in Pyongyang where I presented to North Korean Officials on the potential of mix-use buildings, Kuala Lumpur Titian Budaya Festival where I taught the Malaysian public how to use panels to make solar-powered toys with the OneMaker Group. I also actively pursued mountaineering and ice-climbing, participating and organizing trips to Sichuan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and Malaysia, took part in a few design and athletic competitions (winning a few) and organized and performed in a few music events.  Upon graduating Summa Cum Laude, I served my 4-year bond with the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit where I double-hatted roles most of the time, allowing me to lead the Emergency Response Unit which attends to all railway emergencies in Singapore, Permanent Way Line Maintenance Team (North Zone) which maintains all Permanent Way components on the North South Line, Track Renewal Team which conducts rail replacement works, Engineering team where I served the role of subject matter expert for third rails and structural gauges, Permanent Way Condition Monitoring Team where I helped to process sensor data and human-input data to derive insights and finally the Trains Engineering Team where I worked on integrating sensor data, finding and developing use cases for all 5 centers (Power, Infrastructure, Signals, Permanent Way and Rolling Stock) of the company.
